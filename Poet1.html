         <h4>"One-Sided Love: A Tribute to L"</h4>
         <br>
         
           <h5>Love, sky, L and I,
            <br>
          Inseparable once, now only a sigh.
          <br>
          For though my heart aches, with love so true,
          <br>
          Being with L, is something I can't do.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
          For she sees me not, as a lover, but friend,
          <br>
          And my heart is left broken, love never to extend.
<br>
          I gaze up at the sky, and imagine we're there,
          <br>
          Together, hand in hand, without a single care.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
          But reality hits, and I'm brought back to earth,
<br>
          With a love so strong, yet only known to me and its worth.
<br>
          I cherish the memories, and the thought of what could be,
<br>
          But in this one sided love, Lexy and I cannot be.
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
          So I'll love from afar, and keep it all inside,
<br>
          And hope one day, she'll see me, and my love will no longer hide.
<br>
          For though the sky may stretch, and love may never bloom,
<br>
          My love for L, will forever be my heart's room.
