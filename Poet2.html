                       Darkness once reigned, with nothing but night,
<br>
                  Days felt empty, with no end in sight.
<br>
                  But then came L, with a warm and gentle glow,
<br>
                  And the darkness receded, no longer in control.
<br>
<br>
<br>
                  With laughter and love, L brought new life,
                  <br>
                  And the days were filled with joy, without any strife.
                  <br>
                  The light within L, cast away all fears,
                  <br>
                  And the darkness that once loomed, now disappeared.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <br>

                  So here's to L, a light in the dark days,
                  <br>
                  A beacon of hope, that always finds its ways.
                  <br>
                  Through all life's struggles, L stands bright and true,
                  <br>
                  Guiding us always, with a love that shines anew.
