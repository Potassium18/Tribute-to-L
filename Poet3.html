        <h4>"Autumn's Embrace: A Love for L"</h4>
        <br>  
          <h5>Winter's chill, Summer's heat,
            <br>
            Autumn's hues, and Spring's sweet.
<br>
            Seasons come, and seasons go,
<br>
            Bringing change, to the world below.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            But in the midst of all this change,
<br>
            There's one aura, that never will wane.
<br>
            The autumnal aura of L, so warm and bright,
<br>
            That in its glow, I fell in love, with all my might.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            With every leaf that falls, I'm filled with delight,
<br>
            And the love I feel, shines so pure and bright.
<br>
            In the autumn of my heart, I'll always stay,
<br>
            And love L, till the end of time, come what may.
