          <h5>  The first time we met, L, my heart beat fast,
<br>
            A connection was made, that just couldn't last.
<br>
            Your presence inspired me, to work so hard,
<br>
            To catch your eye, and show you my heart.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Your smile so bright, your laughter so sweet,
            <br>
            Draws me in, makes my heart skip a beat.
            <br>
            I hit the books, with a new determination,
            <br>
            Hoping that you'd see my admiration.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            
            So here I am, with these words I write,
            <br>
            Expressing my feelings, with all my might.
            <br>
            You're my crush, my love, and my heart's desire,
            <br>
            And I'll always hold you, close to my heart's fire.
