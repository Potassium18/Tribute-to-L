        <h4>"Unfulfilled Love: A Tale of Avoidance and Longing"</h4>
        <br>
        
          <h5>   I try to turn away, to hide from sight,
<br>
            To escape the pain, to win the fight.
<br>
            Our love is one-sided, that's evident and true,
<br>
            Yet my heart still hurts, with every day anew.
<br>
            I thought that distance would ease the pain,
<br>
            That time would heal, what love had gained.
<br>
            But every time I try to move on,
<br>
            I find myself drawn, to you alone.
            <br>
<br>
<br>
            I thought I'd find peace, when you were gone,
            <br>
            That I'd forget you, with each new dawn.
            <br>
            But your smile lingers, in my mind,
            <br>
            And every thought of you, is just so kind.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            
            So I tell myself, to walk away,
            <br>
            To find someone new, each passing day.
            <br>
            But every time I try, I find,
            <br>
            That I keep falling, deeper in your mind.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>

            So I'll keep avoiding, the love I feel,
            <br>
            And try to hide, what's real.
            <br>
            But deep inside, I know it's true,
            <br>
            That I keep falling, more in love with you.
